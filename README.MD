## groupie-tracker-search-bar

## Objectives
Groupie Trackers consists on receiving a given API and manipulate the data contained in it, in order to create a site, displaying the information.

Groupie tracker search bar consists of creating a functional program that searches, inside the website, for a specific text input. So the focus of this project is to create a way for the client to search a member or artist or any other attribute in the data system.

1. The program should handle at least these search cases :
- artist/band name
- members
- locations
- first album date
- creation date
2. The program must handle search input as case-insensitive.
3. The search bar must have typing suggestions as you write.
4. The search bar must identify and display in each suggestion the individual type of the search cases. (ex: Freddie Mercury -> member)
For example if you start writing "phil" it should appear as suggestions Phil Collins - member and Phil Collins - artist/band. 

## Instructions
